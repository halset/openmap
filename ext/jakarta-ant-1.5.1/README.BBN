BBN has replaced the jakarta-ant-1.5.1/ release with apache-ant-1.6.1/ in 
order to provide OpenMap users with the most updated version of Ant.

For the purposes of cleaner CVS management, the jakarta-ant-1.5.1 directory
and subdirectories will be left in the ext/ directory.  When OpenMap 4.6.1
is released and the external CVS repository is refreshed, these directories
will be formally deleted.
