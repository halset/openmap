Included in this directory are two batch files for compiling and removing
OpenMap Objects in a Windows/MS-DOS environment.  "buildall.bat" compiles
the entire source tree.  It sets a number of environment variables at the 
beginning of the file to point to software locations and set compiler flags.
It then runs through the entire source tree and compiles all of the *.java
files.

"removeall.bat" runs through the entire tree, removing all of the *.class files
that it finds.
