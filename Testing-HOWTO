OpenMap test script
-------------------

This is a test script for QA of the OpenMap applet/application.  These
directions assume that the tester is at least familiar with the OpenMap GUI.

All problems/questions/flames can be sent to dstl-help@bbn.com.

Applet:
------

Go to the javamap applet demo page http://javamap.bbn.com/demo/.

Follow the links to the latest release page.  You should get to a page with
links to run the applet at different resolutions.  Select you favorite
resolution.

Once the Applet loads, you should see a map of the Eastern U.S. with graticule
lines.  You can now skip to the common Applet/Application instructions.

Application:
-----------

On Windows, run the OpenMap.bat file found in the bin directory.  This file
may need to be configured properly to run on your machine (JDK and CLASSPATH).

On UNIX, run the OpenMap shell script found in the bin directory.  You need
your CLASSPATH set properly before running.


Running the Applet/Application:
------------------------------

	If you don't have a map of anything, verify that a political boundary
	type of layer is turned on in the Layers menu.  If it isn't, then turn
	it on now.

	i) File Menu
		- Select File->About and verify that a popup dialog box
		  describing OpenMap comes up.
		- Other selections except File->Shutdown/Quit should be
		  grayed out.

	ii) Navigate Menu
		- Select Navigate->Coordinates and verify that an internal
		  window with text entry fields comes up. Type in 70,0,0 for
		  DMS Latitude and 180,0,0 for DMS Longitude.  Click apply
		  and the map should recenter over the Chukchi sea.
		  Now select on the "Dec Deg" tab and enter 19.5 latitude, -155.4
		  longitude.  Click apply and the map should recenter over the
		  island of Hawaii.  Close the dialog.
		- Select Navigate->Projection->CADRG to change the projection.
		  Verify that the map redraws (you may not notice much
		  difference).
		- Verify that the Navigate->ZoomIn and Navigate->ZoomOut
		  selections work as advertised.

	iii) Control Menu
		Skip this for now.

	iv) Layers Menu
		- Verify that there are two layer selections, a political boundary
		  type and a graticule type.  If not, then turn them on.
		- Select Layers->Edit Layers.  This should bring up an
		  internal window with a list of layers.  Find the topmost
		  selected layer and move it below the other selected layer by
		  first selecting on the text name of the layer and then
		  clicking on the double-down-arrow box.
		  Make sure this change is reflected in the Map.  Toggle off
		  one layer and verify that it is no longer showing on the
		  map.  Click it back on and it should redraw itself quickly.
		  Now click off both layers, and turn on the DTED layer.

	v) DTED Specialist interaction
		- After the last step in the previous section, you should have
		  an internal window with radio buttons and sliders --the DTED
		  palette.  Select the "Colors" radio button and dismiss the
		  palette.
		- Select Control->Redraw.  The map will change and you will
		  see color terrain data of Hawaii.
		- Select Control->MouseMode->Gestures.  Click on one of the
		  peaks.  You should see some text indicating elevation drawn
		  on the map.
		- If you haven't already, turn off the Layers menu.

	vi) Help Menu
		- Verify that Help->OpenMap points your web browser at the
		  OpenMap help pages.

	vii) Toolbar
		- Verify that the pan rosette works as advertised.  ("Pan
		  West" should move the map center west by 1/2 screen, etc).
		- Verify that the zoom buttons work.  They zoom by a factor of
		  2.
		- Check the scale entry textbox.  Type 250K for 1:250,000.
		  Press return and the map should change the scale.  Try other
		  scales of 1M (1 million), 5m, and 10,000,000.
		- Change the MouseMode back to Navigation mode.  Verify that
		  you get a + mouse cursor when the mouse is over the map.
		  You should also get lat/lon and x/y coordinates showing
		  across the bottom of the map.
		- Click on the map.  The map should recenter where you
		  clicked.  Click and drag a selection box.  The map should
		  zoom and recenter over the selection.

	viii) Random
		- Now go ahead and play around with the various controls in
		  random and senseless ways.  It actually isn't that hard to
		  bring OpenMap to its knees (especially when running as an
		  applet).  Gee I wonder what will happen if I select all
		  the layers?  What happens when I click on and off their
		  palettes while they're getting data?  What about zooming in
		  and out and recentering while they're off getting data?  And
		  how about toggling them on/off when they're out fetching
		  data.

	ix) Acceptable and unacceptable failures
		- It is acceptable for the Java VM or Netscape to crash
		  (SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, GPF/etc) while running OpenMap (blame
		  a broken Netscape or Sun JDK or the underlying OS).
		- It is mostly acceptable for CORBA errors to occur since
		  those are *usually* out of our control.  Often the CORBA
		  errors will go away if you powercycle the offending layer.
		  If problems persist, be sure to contact the email list
		  mentioned at the top of this file.
		- It is NOT ACCEPTABLE if OpenMap gets a NullPointerException,
		  ArrayOutOfBoundsException, or similar exceptions/errors that
		  occur because of bugs in our code.  Please let the mailing
		  list mentioned above know about the problem.  Be
		  sure to include any generated output of the problem.
