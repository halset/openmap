OpenMap(tm)

What is it?
-----------
OpenMap is a Java Beans based toolkit for building applications and
applets needing geographic information.  Using OpenMap components, you
can access data from legacy applications, in-place, in a distributed
setting. At its core, OpenMap is a set of Swing components that
understand geographic coordinates. These components help you show map
data, and help you handle user input events to manipulate that data.


What are the license terms for using OpenMap?
---------------------------------------------
Take a look at the file called LICENSE in the distribution. We want
you to be able to do pretty much anything with it as long as we get
credit for our work and as long as you offer your changes to us so we
can possibly add them to the standard version we distribute.


OpenMap is a trademark
----------------------
OpenMap is a trademark of BBN Corporation. Just so you're not
confused, BBN Corporation is the legal entity, but we're actually part
of GTE Internetworking.
