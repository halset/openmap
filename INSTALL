Prerequisites
=============

   You need to have a Java compiler and VM to build and run the
   OpenMap software.  You will also need the Apache Ant Java-based
   build tool if you'd like to build OpenMap from scratch.  Ant has
   been included in our distribution, but we have omitted the
   documentation package for the sake of space.  If you would like
   the complete Ant package, you may download it from:
	
	http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/
 
   NOTE: From OpenMap 4.0 onwards, OpenMap requires Java 2 to build and run.
   If you need to use JDK 1.1, download OpenMap 3.7, the last 
   JDK 1.1-compatible release.  This release is available at the OpenMap
   web site, http://www.openmap.org

Installation
============

   With Ant, the basic installation of OpenMap has become much easier.
   
   If you would like to build OpenMap, you only need to set your 
   OPENMAP_HOME and JAVA_HOME environment variables to point to your
   OpenMap directory and location of your Java installation, and run 
   "make".  This will work through the different OpenMap directories, 
   compile OpenMap classes with Ant, and store the resulting jar file 
   in the lib/ directory of your OpenMap directory.

   To run OpenMap, whether you have compiled your own jar files or used
   the precompiled jars that came withe distribution, you need only cd
   to the bin/ directory in your OpenMap directory and run the "openmap"
   script.

   The above directions cover use of OpenMap on Unix-based systems, such
   as Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X.  For Windows-based systems, you'll
   want to read the README.win32 file, found in the same directory as
   this INSTALL file.

Documentation
=============
   
   OpenMap is shipped with the API documentation pre-built.  If you'd like
   to rebuild it, you can do it from the top-level OpenMap directory with
   "make docs".
