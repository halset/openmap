A basic set of JSP/Servlet code to display VPF data in a web browser.
All of the data is presented as text, not on a map. It is intended to
help someone trying to understand how VPF tables are constructed, and
how they relate to one another.  It may also be helpful to someone
looking at what attributes are available for particular feature types
in a specific VPF database.

The packages uses J2EE capabilities, and has only been tested under
the Apache Software Foundation's Jakarta Tomcat J2EE engine (4.0).

The package is still fairly basic, and needs some serious redesign.
Much of the package is laid out the way it is because the author went
out of his way to learn about specific J2EE capabilities.

Each installation will need to modify web.xml to reflect the database
name and path to the data for their server.

To build the code, the build.xml file needs to be modified so the
tomcat home directory is set.  You might have to set the servlet.jar
file name (servlet-api.jar for tomcat 5) depending on the version of
tomcat you are using.

Among the improvements needed:
  HTML generation code should move to JSPs wherever possible, java
code should just provide access to the JSP layer.
  The separation into schema and table data into separate servlets
needs to be reconsidered. For basic tables it works, but when joining
multiple tables, the schema section doesn't display this.  Probably
the schema output should be added to the RowMaker classes, since these
classes are what perform the joins.
  Need to be more aggressive about rejecting bad URLs, it might be
possible to get the servlet code to return data not in a database
path, and thus not intended to be shared.
