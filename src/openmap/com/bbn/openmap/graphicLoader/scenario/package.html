<body>

The Scenario GraphicLoader PlugIn package is designed to provide
support for displaying scripted movement of map objects.
<P>

The ScenarioGraphicLoader reads two csv files - a location file that
provides names and icons for a file, and an activity file that
describes entries for the name, along with a lat/lon at a specific
time.  As the activities file is read, the lat/lons are mapped to
time so the ScenarioPoints can figure out where they should be at
different times during the scenario.  The ScenarioPoints interpolate
their locations if the ScenarioGraphicLoader's current time is in
between defined locations.  If the ScenarioPoint should be staying in
one place, then two entries should be placed in the activities file
at the same location with the start and end times of the stationary
position.
