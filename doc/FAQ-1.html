<P>Generic questions about OpenMap, GIS, Web Mapping, etc.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Why is everything copyrighted by BBN if this is GTE?</A>
</H2>

<P>BBN is part of GTE. GTE bought BBN and created GTE Internetworking.
BBN is still the legal entity under which we operate. You can see a
history of BBN at <CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.bbn.com">http://www.bbn.com</A></CODE>
(actually at <CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.bbn.com/aboutbbn/history.htm">http://www.bbn.com/aboutbbn/history.htm</A></CODE>) where you'll see
that we helped build the ARPANET which eventually became the Internet.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Why is BBN Technologies releasing OpenMap as open source?</A>
</H2>

<P>The OpenMap group is in the part of BBN that does contract R&amp;D
work. We don't consider ourselves a product development group. We felt
that the best thing we could do with OpenMap was release the sources,
invite other people to help make it better, and benefit some of the
Open GIS Consortium testbed efforts at the same time.  We are, of
course, also available to provide you with OpenMap help or any other
distributed systems software R&amp;D. If you want to learn more,
contact us at <CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:openmap@bbn.com">openmap@bbn.com</A></CODE> or browse our web site.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What's that funny-shaped thing in the Logo?</A>
</H2>

<P>That's Antarctica. The "open" continent. Home of the penguin, and we
do a lot of our work on Linux systems. Not to mention that
Antarctica's kind of a cool place.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Can OpenMap display CADRG, CIB, RPF?</A>
</H2>

<P>Yes and no. We have some code that can do it. We can't include it as
part of this release until we iron out some copyright issues since
part of the code to do RPF is from an outside contributor. We'll add
it to the release as soon as we can.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 What is CADRG, CIB, and RPF?</A>
</H2>

<P>The first two are data types, the latter is a format. These come from
the US National Imagery and Mapping Agency
<CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.nima.mil">http://www.nima.mil</A></CODE> CADRG is Compressed ADRG, a form of
raster map.  CIB is Controlled Image Base, an imagery product.  RPF is
Raster Product Format, i.e. the underling format of CADRG and CIB.

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 Where's the CORBA part of OpenMap?</A>
</H2>

<P>We'll release that in a future release. Right now we're concentrating
on getting a version out that's easy to build and easy to work with.
