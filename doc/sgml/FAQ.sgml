<abstract>
This FAQ contains questions and answers about the OpenMap system.
</abstract>


<toc>



<sect>General
<p>
Generic questions about OpenMap, GIS, Web Mapping, etc.



<sect1>Why is everything copyrighted by BBN if this is GTE?
<p>
BBN is part of GTE. GTE bought BBN and created GTE Internetworking.
BBN is still the legal entity under which we operate. You can see a
history of BBN at <tt><htmlurl url="http://www.bbn.com"></tt>
(actually at <tt><htmlurl
url="http://www.bbn.com/roles/researcher/timeline/"></tt>) where
you'll see that we helped build the ARPANET which eventually became
the Internet.


<sect1>Why is BBN Technologies releasing OpenMap as open source?
<p>
The OpenMap group is in the part of BBN that does contract R&amp;D
work. We don't consider ourselves a product development group. We felt
that the best thing we could do with OpenMap was release the sources,
invite other people to help make it better, and benefit some of the
Open GIS Consortium testbed efforts at the same time.  We are, of
course, also available to provide you with OpenMap help or any other
distributed systems software R&amp;D. If you want to learn more,
contact us at <tt><htmlurl url="mailto:openmap@bbn.com"
name="openmap@bbn.com"></tt> or browse our web site.


<sect1>What's that funny-shaped thing in the Logo?
<p>
That's Antarctica. The "open" continent. Home of the penguin, and we
do a lot of our work on Linux systems. Not to mention that
Antarctica's kind of a cool place.


<sect1>What types of data does OpenMap support?
<p>
OpenMap comes with built-in support for <htmlurl
url="http://www.nima.mil/" name="NIMA"> DCW, VPF, VMAP and
CADRG, CIB, RPF; OpenMap also has support for <htmlurl
url="http://www.esri.com/" name="ESRI"> Shapefiles.  OpenMap can
display both vector and raster geospatial data.  You can use OpenMap
to develop map layers which can display your own private formats.


<sect1>Can OpenMap display CADRG, CIB, RPF?
<p>
Yes, we have code that can display this data.  RPF support is new as
of OpenMap 3.2.


<sect1>What is CADRG, CIB, and RPF?
<p>
The first two are data types, the latter is a format. These come from
the US National Imagery and Mapping Agency <tt><htmlurl
url="http://www.nima.mil/"></tt> CADRG is Compressed ADRG, a form of
raster map.  CIB is Controlled Image Base, an imagery product.  RPF is
Raster Product Format, i.e. the underlying format of CADRG and CIB.

<sect1>Where's the CORBA part of OpenMap?
<p>
We'll release that in a future release. Right now we're concentrating
on getting a version out that's easy to build and easy to work with.



<sect>OpenMap Source Code
<p>
Questions concerning the core OpenMap source code.

<sect1>When adding ESRI shape files to OpenMap I don't see (some/all)
of the data.  What's wrong?
<p>
The Openmap <htmlurl
url="api/com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.ShapeLayer.html"
name="ShapeLayer"> uses a customized indexing scheme to efficiently
draw the shape file data.  You'll need to create a spatial index from
your shape file.  A spatial index is different from a shape index
(.shx) file.
<p>
To generate a spatial index from a "country.shp" file do the following:
<verb>
java com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.SpatialIndex -c country.ssx country.shp
</verb>
This creates the Spatial Index file (country.ssx) from the country.shp
file.  Then you need to change the attribute in the openmap.properties
file:
<verb>
country.spatialIndex=country.ssx
</verb>
Be sure to substitute the correct name of your shape file and layer
for the word 'country' in the examples above.


<sect1>I've written a layer that is part of the map but sometimes it
doesn't show its data.
<p>
Assuming you're using the LatLon OMGraphics objects to represent your
graphical data, this situation occurs when you try to render the
OMGraphics before generating them.  The basic rule of thumb is that
each time you get a new projection object, (from
<tt/projectionChanged()/), you need to invoke
<tt/OMGraphic.generate()/, and then force a <tt/repaint()/ of the map.
If your layer has worker threads, then you can hold on to the current
projection to use at any time.  The generation process is critical for
LatLon OMGraphics because the graphics are projected into XY in order
to be rendered.
<p>
For performance reasons, you may want to design your layer/application
to work strictly in XY space.  You can do this if you don't intend to
switch projection types, and if all the LatLon data you want to
display is static.  For this case you could project all data at
layer/application initialization and then just rerender the data as
the user pans and zooms on the map.  The OpenMap toolkit is well
suited for both dynamic and static data models.



<sect>OpenMap Viewer Application
<p>
Questions concerning the basic OpenMap viewer application.


<sect1>I've written my own layer and I want to see it using the
OpenMap Viewer Application.
<p>
First you need to add the appropriate properties references to the
<tt/openmap.properties/ file in your home directory or in the
<tt>share/</tt> subdirectory of the OpenMap installation.  Change the
`openmap.layers' property to something like:
<verb>
	# layers to load and show on the map
	openmap.layers=quake myLayer political graticule
	# layers that are part of the map on startup
	openmap.startUpLayers=graticule political myLayer
</verb>
Here you've specified that the `myLayer' be part of the list of
layers, in the second position from the top of the map, right
underneath the `quake' identifier.  For the `myLayer' identifier, you
will need to specify at least two other properties:
<verb>
	myLayer.class=com.myCompany.projects.MyLayer
	myLayer.prettyName=My Cool Layer
</verb>
The `myLayer.class' property is the full class-name for your layer.
The `myLayer.prettyName' property is the human-readable name that you
want to appear in the list of layers.  These properties are passed to
and processed by the base <tt><htmlurl
url="./api/com.bbn.openmap.Layer.html" name="Layer"></tt> class via
<tt/Layer.setProperties()/.  You can provide additional configuration
strings to the <tt><htmlurl url="../share/openmap.properties"
name="openmap.properties"></tt> file and override
<tt/Layer.setProperties()/ in your own layer to process them:
<verb>
    // prefix should be `myLayer' for this layer
    public void setProperties (String prefix, java.util.Properties props) {
        // Let the Layer process the basic layer properties
        super.setProperties(prefix, props);

        // now do my stuff
	String foo = props.getProperty(prefix + ".fooProperty", "defaultFoo");
	// ...
    }
</verb>
<p>
After adding your layer to the properties file, you need to launch the
OpenMap viewer application with the appropriate augmented CLASSPATH
pointing to your layer code.  Assuming you configured, built, and
installed the OpenMap package, launch the viewer like this:
<verb>
	/usr/local/openmap/bin/openmap -x &lt;classpath_to_your_layer&gt;
</verb>


<sect1>Do you have any suggestions for debugging my layer/application
with OpenMap?
<p>
As of writing this, most of us haven't yet come across a good Java
debugger.  But <htmlurl url="http://www.cygnus.com/" name="Cygnus"> is
working on a Java front end to gdb, the GNU debugger.
<p>
Most of our debugging is done with the Java equivalent of printfs,
(System.out.printlns), at crucial places in the code.  And we
sometimes use the classes <tt><htmlurl
url="./api/com.bbn.openmap.util.Debug.html"
name="com.bbn.openmap.util.Debug"></tt> and <tt><htmlurl
url="./api/com.bbn.openmap.util.Assert.html"
name="com.bbn.openmap.util.Assert"></tt> to leave permanent (but not
necessary visible) checks throughout the code.
<p>
To use the Debug class, you must first initialize it with one of the
<tt/Debug.init()/ methods.  (Note: the OpenMap Viewer application does
this already, so if you're debugging your own layer within this
application, you don't need to take this step).  Your layer code
should have statements like this:
<verb>
	if (Debug.debugging("debugMyLayer")) {
	    System.out.println("about to do something daring...");
	}
</verb>
<p>
Once you're ready to run and debug your layer, you should launch the
Java VM with the flag `-Ddebug.debugMyLayer'.  Assuming your CLASSPATH
is set up properly to point to your layer code, this becomes:
<verb>
	/usr/local/openmap/bin/openmap -Ddebug.debugMyLayer -x $CLASSPATH
</verb>




<sect>OpenMap as an Applet
<p>
Questions concerning using OpenMap as an Applet.


<sect1>Can I run OpenMap as an applet?
<p>
Yes.

<sect1>How?
<p>
Move the files share/omapplet.html and lib/openmap.jar to a directory
where they can be served up by an HTTP (web) server.  Then point your
browser at the omapplet.html file.  You will be prompted to download
the Java Plug-in if you don't already have it installed.  Once the
Plug-in is installed, you should see OpenMap load and display.

<sect1>How do I get the Java Plug-in?
<p>
It's automatically loaded when the applet is accessed.  If you want to
get it directly you can get it at 
<tt><htmlurl url="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/"></tt>.

<sect1>How do I create my own Java Plug-in applet html files?
<p>
Create an html file with code for an applet as documented in almost
any Java book.  Java in a Nutshell by David Flanagan (O'Reilly) has a
good section for instance.  Then use Sun's HTML Converter to convert
that file to an applet file that will automatically load the Java
Plug-in.  You can find a pointer to the converter at
<tt><htmlurl url="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/"></tt>.

<sect1>Why don't shape files work in an Applet?
<p>
The customer who paid for the Shape file work had specific
requirements and constraints.  Those were met by using a
RandomAccessFile implementation of a Shape file reader.  That customer
was only interested in an OpenMap based application, not an applet.
Unfortunately, applets do not have access to the file system, and
RandomAccessFile only works if it has access to a file system.
<p>
In order for Shape files to work in an applet there will have to be an
alternate implementation that can read the shape file via an input
stream instead.  This would enable OpenMap to instantiate an input
stream from a file or a URL.  There are no technical roadblocks to
this sort of implementation.  We do not have a customer who wants to
pay for that work.  If you're looking for a way to contribute to
OpenMap this would be a great project.
