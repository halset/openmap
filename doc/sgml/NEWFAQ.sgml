<title>OpenMap FAQ
<author>BBN Technologies
<date>15 February 2000
<abstract>
This FAQ contains questions and answers about the OpenMap system.
</abstract>


<toc>

<sect>General questions

<sect1>Why is everything copyrighted by BBN if this is GTE?
<p>
BBN was bought by GTE, but BBN is still the legal entity under which we 
operate. You can see a history of BBN at 
<tt><htmlurl url="http://www.bbn.com"></tt>
(actually at <tt><htmlurl
url="http://www.bbn.com/roles/researcher/timeline/"></tt>) where
you'll see that we helped build the ARPANET which eventually became
the Internet.

<sect1>Why is BBN Technologies releasing OpenMap as open source?
<p>
The OpenMap group is in the part of BBN that does contract R&amp;D
work. We don't consider ourselves a product development group. We felt
that the best thing we could do with OpenMap was release the sources,
invite other people to help make it better, and benefit some of the
Open GIS Consortium testbed efforts at the same time.  We are, of
course, also available to provide you with OpenMap help or any other
distributed systems software R&amp;D. If you want to learn more,
contact us at <tt><htmlurl url="mailto:openmap@bbn.com"
name="openmap@bbn.com"></tt> or browse our web site.

<sect1>What's that funny-shaped thing in the Logo?
<p>
That's Antarctica. The "open" continent. Home of the penguin, and we
do a lot of our work on Linux systems. Not to mention that
Antarctica's kind of a cool place.


<sect>OpenMap Description
<p>
High-level functionality-type questions.  Details on actual
implementation is covered in the Components section.

<sect1>How can I put my data on a map?
<p>
In general, data is placed on a map by a Layer.  The OpenMap package
comes with layers that can display several different standard data
formats, including ESRI Shapefiles and NIMA's RPF, VPF and DTED data.
There are also layers that let you read in data from a CSV (Comma
Separated Value) file and display the locations from it.  To display
your data, look through the layer packages to see if your data type is
handled by an existing layer.  The Layer API java documentation should
have information on how to configure the layer to display your data.
<p>If your data type isn't supported by an existing layer, you can
write a Layer to do it instead.  The Components section has more
details on how to write a Layer to display data objects.

<sect1>Can I select, modify, or query graphics?
<p>
OpenMap maps are made up of graphical objects which can react to user
inputs.  The OpenMap architecture has the mechanism in place to
distibute mouse and keyboard events to Layers that want to receive
them.  The Layer has the capability to change a graphic's appearance,
add or delete graphics, or provide more information about a graphic.
The graphic's information can be displayed in a Web browser,
a text line section, or a pop-up window.

<sect1>What are palettes?
<p>
Every Layer has the capability of displaying a unique user interface
inside a frame window.  These windows, called palettes, give the user
direct access to a Layer to control how it displays its graphics.

<sect1>How flexible is the Layer interface?  Are there any
restrictions on how to create a Layer?
<p>
Since Layers are Java Swing components, they are totally responsible for
drawing themselves, as part of a greater whole.  Java Swing handles
the layering of graphics from multiple layers.  That said, the fact
that the Layers are so independent gives them great leway on how they
can access their data source and create their graphics for the map.
They can access data files and data servers in any manner imagined.
Layers can act as clients, creating graphics from data received from a
server, or simply displaying graphics acquired from a server.  They
can also create graphics from internal algorithms.
<p>
Some restrictions get imposed on Layers if they are being used
inside an Applet.  In this case, the Layers are subject to the
security restrictions imposed on applet objects - Layers that are
designed to contact a server may only contact a server that is
residing on the computer from where the applet was loaded.

<sect>Hardware and Development Environment Requirements
<p>
What do you need to run and develop with OpenMap?

<sect1>What systems have you tested OpenMap on?

<sect1>What JDK issues are there?

<sect1>What GUI builders have you worked with?
<p>
Very few, and none seriously.

<sect1>Can I use OpenMap in Symantec Visual Cafe?  I get the "jar file
contains no valid beans" message when I try to load in openmap.jar.
<p>
Symantec's Visual Cafe product requires that beans be "100% JavaBean
compliant", according to the Sun JavaBeans(tm) specification available
at Sun's Java web site at <tt><htmlurl
url="http://java.sun.com/beans/docs/spec.html"></tt>. Right now, the
openmap.jar file is not 100% JavaBean compliant, and thus cannot be
imported as a component.

While the bean is not all the way there, however, it should be
relatively close.  Since OpenMap is open source, we welcome
contributions from the user community, including the necessary
modifications to bring the jar files up to spec.  If you're interested
in contributing, send mail to openmap@bbn.com and let us know!


<sect>About the OpenMap Package
<sect1> What does the OpenMap package contain?
<p>
The OpenMap package contains toolkit components, and a couple of
mapping applications.
<P>
The OpenMap components are Java Swing components, and can be used to
add functionality to existing applications, or combined with other
components to create a unique application.
<p>
The com.bbn.openmap.app.OpenMap class is the primary OpenMap
application provided in the package, and also serves as an example of
how to connect the components together.  There are simple examples
located in the com.bbn.openmap.examples package which demonstrate the
basics of using graphics and layers within a MapBean to create a map.

<sect1> Where should I start if I'm a novice user?
<p>
The best place to start for a novice user is to get the OpenMap
application working as it is provided in the package.  The java
classes are precompiled in the openmap.jar file included in the
openmap/lib directory, and can be run as downloaded.  Look at the
following sections for information on compiling and running OpenMap on
your platform.
<p>
The configuration of the OpenMap application can be adjusted by
modifying the entries in the openmap.properties file located in the
openmap/share directory.  This file can be copied into your personal
home directory and modifed to add/delete layers as well as to adjust
the starting location and scale of the MapBean.

<sect1> Where should I start if I'm a toolkit developer?
<p>
Toolkit developers are more likely to be interested in the
com.bbn.openmap.MapBean class and how it interacts with applications
and Layers.  The MapBean examples in the com.bbn.openmap.examples
package demostrate how to integrate the MapBean, with Layers, into a
simple window.  The com.bbn.openmap.app.OpenMap application provides
an example of integrating all the components together.

<sect1> What does OpenMap's architecture look like?

<sect>Using/Building OpenMap
<sect1> How can I compile and run on Windows?
<p>
OpenMap comes with jar files and scripts to let you run under Windows with
little configuration.  To get it running on your system, you'll first need
to:

<list>
<item> Load the openmap.bat batch file in your favorite editor.
<item> Change the path to the Java virtual machine to match where your
installation of Java is.  
<item> Change the path of OpenMap to match
where you unpacked the distribution.
</list>

Then, run the openmap.bat file.

If you want to build OpenMap from the source code yourself, we recommend
the cygwin toolkit from Cygnus (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin).  Note
that we've had better luck under Windows NT than Windows 95 or 98, as there
are some problems with long command lines under these operating systems.

<sect1> How can I compile and run on Unix?
<p>

You'll need to have a Java compiler and VM to build and run the OpenMap
software, as well as the Java Foundation Classes (JFC).  

Once you have this software on your system, you can:

<list>
<item> `cd' to the top level directory of the OpenMap package and type
`./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
using csh on an old version of System V, you might need to type `sh
./configure' instead to prevent sh from trying to execute `configure'
itself.
<item> Type `make' to compile the package.
<item> Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files
and documentation.
<item> If you want documentation, type `make docs'.  NOTE: javadoc
documentation is now pre-built.  This step is unnecessary unless you
want to rebuild the javadoc documentation.
<item> To install the documentation, type `make install-docs'.
</list>

You can test OpenMap by running the various launch scripts provided in
the bin/ and the com/bbn/openmap/examples/ directories.  Read the
INSTALL file in the distribution for more information.

<sect1> What flavors of Unix do you work with?
<p>
We've successfully tested on Solaris 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.6, and 2.7, as well as
RedHat Linux 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, and 6.1.  OpenMap should work on any system on
which you have a Java compiler, VM, and the Java Foundation Classes.

<sect1> How can I compile and run on a Macintosh?
<p>
Because the Java runtime is only JDK 1.1.X compliant, there are some
modifications that need to be made to some parts of the code.
We've done our best to keep the OpenMap components JDK 1.1.X
compliant, but there are some graphics objects that take advantage of
the Java 2D API that JDK 1.2 provides.  The code that relies on JDK
1.2 can be deleted from the build, and the majority of the components
will build correctly.
<p>
We've built the code using CodeWarrior on a Mac.

<sect1> How can I generate the Javadoc documentation?
<p>
The Javadocs come pre-built with the OpenMap distribution in the doc/
directory.  If you want to rebuild the documentation, read the answer
above for compiling/running under Unix.

<sect1>Do you have any suggestions for debugging my layer/application
with OpenMap?
<p>
As of writing this, most of us haven't yet come across a good Java
debugger.  But <htmlurl url="http://www.cygnus.com/" name="Cygnus"> is
working on a Java front end to gdb, the GNU debugger.
<p>
Most of our debugging is done with the Java equivalent of printfs,
(System.out.printlns), at crucial places in the code.  And we
sometimes use the classes <tt><htmlurl
url="./api/com/bbn/openmap/util/Debug.html"
name="com.bbn.openmap.util.Debug"></tt> and <tt><htmlurl
url="./api/com/bbn/openmap/util/Assert.html"
name="com.bbn.openmap.util.Assert"></tt> to leave permanent (but not
necessary visible) checks throughout the code.
<p>
To use the Debug class, you must first initialize it with one of the
<tt/Debug.init()/ methods.  (Note: the OpenMap Viewer application does
this already, so if you're debugging your own layer within this
application, you don't need to take this step).  Your layer code
should have statements like this:
<verb>
	if (Debug.debugging("debugMyLayer")) {
	    System.out.println("about to do something daring...");
	}
</verb>
<p>
Once you're ready to run and debug your layer, you should launch the
Java VM with the flag `-Ddebug.debugMyLayer'.  Assuming your CLASSPATH
is set up properly to point to your layer code, this becomes:
<verb>
	/usr/local/openmap/bin/openmap -Ddebug.debugMyLayer -x $CLASSPATH
</verb>

<sect>Components
<sect1> What is the MapBean?
<p>
The MapBean is a Java Swing component that represents a map window.
It serves as the keeper of the projection, which is the description of
how the map should be drawn (latitude/longitude location, scale,
projection type, pixel height and width of the map).  The MapBean also
acts as the parent class to the Layer objects, which act as child
components to the MapBean.
<p>
You can change the map by modifying the projection that the MapBean
has, or by changing the layers that are contained within the MapBean.
The Layers listen for any changes to the projection in the MapBean,
update their graphics accordingly, and then redraw themselves.

<sect1> What projections are available?
<p>
We've included a Mercator, Orthographic, and Gnomic projection on the
package, as defined by the USGS Projection Manual 1932.  There is also
a CADRG projection, which is actually an Albers Equal Arc projection
that is compliant with the pixel spacings defined in NIMA's Raster
Product Format (RPF) specification.  Finally there is a simple XY
projection as well.
<p>
OpenMap projections are able to do more than forward and inverse
translations - they are capable of defining these functions for
different shape types, attempting to resolve some of the ambiguities
of drawing these graphics on a globe.

<sect1> What does the InformationDelegator do?
<sect1> What do Listeners do?
<sect1> What are MouseModes?
<sect1> What are OpenMap's scale units?
<p>

OpenMap's scale is a ratio, based on a pixelsPerMeter constant that we
computed long ago.  (It's roughly the number of pixels per meter on a
Sun monitor from 1994.)  The idea was that projections are calculated
in meters, and that the pixelsPerMeter should be settable to match
your output device.  In theory, the scale would have been a measurable
quantity.
	
In practice, X-windows was supposed to provide a way of getting the
actual pPM but few vendors went through the trouble of setting the
value properly.  In the meantime, the OpenMap's scale can be used as a
general ratio.

<sect1> Cover projectionChanged tricks
<sect1> Cover SwingWorkers
<sect1>I've written my own layer and I want to see it using the
OpenMap Viewer Application.
<p>
First you need to add the appropriate properties references to the
<tt/openmap.properties/ file in your home directory or in the
<tt>share/</tt> subdirectory of the OpenMap installation.  Change the
`openmap.layers' property to something like:
<verb>
	# layers to load and show on the map
	openmap.layers=quake myLayer political graticule
	# layers that are part of the map on startup
	openmap.startUpLayers=graticule political myLayer
</verb>
Here you've specified that the `myLayer' be part of the list of
layers, in the second position from the top of the map, right
underneath the `quake' identifier.  For the `myLayer' identifier, you
will need to specify at least two other properties:
<verb>
	myLayer.class=com.myCompany.projects.MyLayer
	myLayer.prettyName=My Cool Layer
</verb>
The `myLayer.class' property is the full class-name for your layer.
The `myLayer.prettyName' property is the human-readable name that you
want to appear in the list of layers.  These properties are passed to
and processed by the base <tt><htmlurl
url="./api/com/bbn/openmap/Layer.html" name="Layer"></tt> class via
<tt/Layer.setProperties()/.  You can provide additional configuration
strings to the <tt><htmlurl url="../share/openmap.properties"
name="openmap.properties"></tt> file and override
<tt/Layer.setProperties()/ in your own layer to process them:
<verb>
    // prefix should be `myLayer' for this layer
    public void setProperties (String prefix, java.util.Properties props) {
        // Let the Layer process the basic layer properties
        super.setProperties(prefix, props);

        // now do my stuff
	String foo = props.getProperty(prefix + ".fooProperty", "defaultFoo");
	// ...
    }
</verb>
<p>
After adding your layer to the properties file, you need to launch the
OpenMap viewer application with the appropriate augmented CLASSPATH
pointing to your layer code.  Assuming you configured, built, and
installed the OpenMap package, launch the viewer like this:
<verb>
	/usr/local/openmap/bin/openmap -x &lt;classpath_to_your_layer&gt;
</verb>

<sect1>I've written a layer that is part of the map but sometimes it
doesn't show its data.
<p>
Assuming you're using the LatLon OMGraphics objects to represent your
graphical data, this situation occurs when you try to render the
OMGraphics before generating them.  The basic rule of thumb is that
each time you get a new projection object, (from
<tt/projectionChanged()/), you need to invoke
<tt/OMGraphic.generate()/, and then force a <tt/repaint()/ of the map.
If your layer has worker threads, then you can hold on to the current
projection to use at any time.  The generation process is critical for
LatLon OMGraphics because the graphics are projected into XY in order
to be rendered.
<p>
For performance reasons, you may want to design your layer/application
to work strictly in XY space.  You can do this if you don't intend to
switch projection types, and if all the LatLon data you want to
display is static.  For this case you could project all data at
layer/application initialization and then just rerender the data as
the user pans and zooms on the map.  The OpenMap toolkit is well
suited for both dynamic and static data models.

<sect1>Where's the CORBA part of OpenMap?
<p>
We'll release that in a future release. Right now we're concentrating
on getting a version out that's easy to build and easy to work with.

<sect>Data
Questions about supported data types and problems managing specific types of 
data.

<sect1>What types of data does OpenMap support?
<p>
OpenMap comes with built-in support for <htmlurl
url="http://www.nima.mil/" name="NIMA"> DCW, VPF, VMAP and
CADRG, CIB, RPF; OpenMap also has support for <htmlurl
url="http://www.esri.com/" name="ESRI"> Shapefiles.  OpenMap can
display both vector and raster geospatial data.  You can use OpenMap
to develop map layers which can display your own private formats.

<sect1>Can OpenMap display CADRG, CIB, RPF?
<p>
Yes, we have code that can display this data.  RPF support is new as
of OpenMap 3.2.

<sect1>What is CADRG, CIB, and RPF?
<p>
The first two are data types, the latter is a format. These come from
the US National Imagery and Mapping Agency <tt><htmlurl
url="http://www.nima.mil/"></tt> CADRG is Compressed ADRG, a form of
raster map.  CIB is Controlled Image Base, an imagery product.  RPF is
Raster Product Format, i.e. the underlying format of CADRG and CIB.
<tt><htmlurl
url="http://164.214.2.59:80/publications/specs/index.html"></tt>

<sect1> Does OpenMap read Arc/Info or GeoTIFF files?
<p>
Not at the moment.  We haven't worked with projects that have required
reading Arc/Info or GeoTIFF files.  Please let us know if you would 
like to contribute a reader!

<sect1> You didn't list this specific data type.  When will you support it?


<sect1>When adding ESRI shape files to OpenMap I don't see (some/all)
of the data.  What's wrong?
<p>
The Openmap <htmlurl
url="api/com/bbn/openmap/layer/shape/ShapeLayer.html"
name="ShapeLayer"> uses a customized indexing scheme to efficiently
draw the shape file data.  You'll need to create a spatial index from
your shape file.  A spatial index is different from a shape index
(.shx) file.
<p>
To generate a spatial index from a "country.shp" file do the following:
<verb>
java com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.SpatialIndex -c country.ssx country.shp
</verb>
This creates the Spatial Index file (country.ssx) from the country.shp
file.  Then you need to change the attribute in the openmap.properties
file:
<verb>
country.spatialIndex=country.ssx
</verb>
Be sure to substitute the correct name of your shape file and layer
for the word 'country' in the examples above.

<sect1> How can I use the .dbf files that came with my shape file data
through OpenMap?

<p>
The .dbf file holds attributes for the graphical objects stored in
the shapefile (.shp).  There are a couple of ways you can go to
take advantage of the information in that file.  You can load the
file into the database, and then perform queries into the database
from within the Layer, and then associate the attributes to the
OpenMap grpahical objects created from the shapefile.  You can also
convert the .dbf file to a csv file, and then do the same thing.
There is a package com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.areas that helps with
this approach that will be in the next release of OpenMap.

We do not provide a generic solution for this, because it is our
experience that there isn't one.  We've always had to come up with
specialized code to display the graphics and attributes in a manner
that was appropriate for the particular goal of the layer.

<sect1> What image formats are available?
<sect1> What about the GIF format?  


<sect>OpenMap as an Applet
<p>
Questions concerning using OpenMap as an Applet.


<sect1>Can I run OpenMap as an applet?
<p>
Yes.

<sect1>How?
<p>
Move the files share/omapplet.html and lib/openmap.jar to a directory
where they can be served up by an HTTP (web) server.  Then point your
browser at the omapplet.html file.  You will be prompted to download
the Java Plug-in if you don't already have it installed.  Once the
Plug-in is installed, you should see OpenMap load and display.

<sect1>How do I get the Java Plug-in?
<p>
It's automatically loaded when the applet is accessed.  If you want to
get it directly you can get it at 
<tt><htmlurl url="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/"></tt>.

<sect1>How do I create my own Java Plug-in applet html files?
<p>
Create an html file with code for an applet as documented in almost
any Java book.  Java in a Nutshell by David Flanagan (O'Reilly) has a
good section for instance.  Then use Sun's HTML Converter to convert
that file to an applet file that will automatically load the Java
Plug-in.  You can find a pointer to the converter at
<tt><htmlurl url="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/"></tt>.

<sect1>Why don't shape files work in an Applet?
<p>
The customer who paid for the Shape file work had specific
requirements and constraints.  Those were met by using a
RandomAccessFile implementation of a Shape file reader.  That customer
was only interested in an OpenMap based application, not an applet.
Unfortunately, applets do not have access to the file system, and
RandomAccessFile only works if it has access to a file system.
<p>
In order for Shape files to work in an applet there will have to be an
alternate implementation that can read the shape file via an input
stream instead.  This would enable OpenMap to instantiate an input
stream from a file or a URL.  There are no technical roadblocks to
this sort of implementation.  We do not have a customer who wants to
pay for that work.  If you're looking for a way to contribute to
OpenMap this would be a great project.
